# Data_egineering_exercise
This is a little data engineering exercise where I explored web scraping, ETL pipeline to clean data as well as inserting the cleaned data into a mongodb database.
I'll go deeper into all of these aspects with time and produce a better and more scalable algorithm.
Also, I'd like to go a little bit futher by contenarizing the ETL application with docker
